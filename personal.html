                My primary passion is music, most specifically bluegrass banjo, which I have made the majority of my income from for the last four years. I enjoy working with my hands and what started out as doing minor repairs for students quickly turned into full-on luthiery; that is building quality instruments, primarily banjos and Irish bouzoukis. I have had the opportunity to travel the world playing music, having done three tours in New Zealand, a several month stint in Uganda and most recently my band, <a href="https://www.scratchdogstringband.com/">Scratchdog Stringband</a>, was awarded a federal grant to tour in eastern Russia. I enjoy teaching others and have taught classes to individuals and at various colleges. I have always loved to experience foreign cultures and spent my college years in Cork, in the south of Ireland. There I studied Gaeilge, the native Celtic Irish language and love to converse with anyone else who shares this arcane interest. Myself and my colleague run a non-profit that puts on the <a href="https://bridgetownbluegrass.com/">Bridgetown Bluegrass Festival</a> each year, earning money for homeless shelters and youth music programs. I also posses a strong interest in fermentation science and spent twelve years as a brewer and cider maker. I enjoy building my own stills and making spirits and tinctures at home. Currently I live with my wife and dog in Portland, the city where I was raised.
