TEST TO SEE IF YOU'LL ACTUALLY SAVE MY CHANGES THIS TIME
This is my first attempt at a READme.
This is an updated personal portfolio designed to make perspective employers learn about my skills, my background and to see examples of my work. It contains a navigation bar to facilitate usuability of the site. Included is a footer on each page as well as a link to hire.
